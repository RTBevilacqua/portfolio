			<h2>Recipick</h2>
			<img alt="image of recipick website" id="recipick-fullscreen" src="images/recipick-fullscreen.png">
			<p><span class="the-start">The Problem</span><br> It is too time consuming to think of something to make due to the massive amount of choices on the internet.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="the-start">The Solution</span><br> Create an app that allows the user, either on their phone or computer, to find a selection of top recipes through only a few choices.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="the-start">The Process</span><br> When I began to think of ideas for this app I first started doing research on humans and choices. During my research I came across a lecture from Sheena Lyengar titled after her book “The Art of Choosing”. Her talk was the main inspiration in the design of my app as Lyengar describes her findings during her research on humans and the decisions they make when presented with multiple options.<br>
			<br>
			I decided to give the user 10 selections for each category and provide 2 categories with 1 results page where they select their recipe. After doing some testing I later changed the amount of selections to 8 per category after finding that 10 options were too many.<br>
			<br>
			When I received user feedback on the app the main issue was there was no button to go to homepage. I am currently working on fixing this problem but over all the app received great feedback.<br>

			<h2>West Palm Beach</h2>
			<img alt="image of West Palm Beach website" id="wpb-fullscreen" src="images/WPB.png">
			<p><span class="the-start">The Problem</span><br>  The city I currently live in, has a web page that contains way too much information and in my opinion is poorly designed.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="the-start">The Solution</span><br> Create a website that is stimulating and entices the viewer so that they want to come visit West Palm Beach and do more research about the city.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="the-start">The Process</span><br> I believe that a city or town should have two websites, one that is for visitors or people looking for something to do, and the other for residents who are looking for information on the government, town hall meetings, and so on. <br>
			<br>
			The site that I designed is for visitors to attract them to the city of West Palm Beach.  
			The first thing to research was to find the best attractions in the area and display them into two categories, day and night. This research was done by talking to locals, and searching places on Google, TripAdvisor, and Yelp. It was important to me to not name specific restaurants or bars but to give the main locations with places to eat and drink. This leads to an unbias result which allows the user to look up the restaurants he/she would enjoy, ex. "dive bars in West Palm Beach, or fancy restaurants West Palm Beach".<br>
			<br>
			I also wanted to have a page dedicated to the history of the city. I feel that even though this may not be as exciting as looking at things to do in the city, there are still travelers who are fascinated with history and this should not be overlooked.<br> 
			<br>
			I used the mobile first approach when designing this and decided to keep my mobile design the same as my desktop design due to its aesthetics and ease of use.<br>

			<h2>Quiz App</h2>
			<img alt="image of Quiz App" id="quizapp-fullscreen" src="images/quizapp.png">
			<p><span class="the-start">The Problem</span><br>
			I had to create a quiz that allowed the user to select their answer from multiple choices.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="the-start">The Solution</span><br>
			Create a question with four multiple choice answers that are stored in an array.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="the-start">The Process</span><br>
			Being that I am obsessed with film I decided to create a quiz on film directors. At first I was looking up films that would challenge the user but then decided to make the questions a little easier since we all like to win.<br>
			<br>
			I already knew that I wanted to style this by presenting the app as if the user was watching a film. What I didn’t know was how I would keep track of the correct answers which ended up being the most challenging part for me.<br>
			<br>
			When I submitted this to receive user feedback I received much praise but had a few issues regarding the Action button being hidden on certain screen sizes which wouldn’t allow the user to advance to the questions.<br>
